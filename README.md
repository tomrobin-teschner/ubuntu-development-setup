The provided script provides some useful installations for ubuntu 20.04 or higher. Its main purpose is to provide a somewhat sane environmnt for scientific / HPC orientated application development (c/c++ compilers, distributed memory management (MPI), build systems, etc.)

The default compilers that will be installed are GCC and Clang. Based on that, the lua-based module system [LMOD](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be installed, as well as the HPC package management system [easybuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/index.html). Easybuild will allow to easily install software and libraries that may be useful for development purposes.
